      text: 'Davian, \nI’m glad to hear you escaped Falsk without incident. You gave Freir quite the story to write. I hope you’re okay with a few embellishments, he’s a reporter, after all, and he sometimes can’t help himself. You’ve probably already found the article that came with this letter. Congratulations, you’re famous for the next week or so. Other people would kill for that kind of publicity. In a way, you’ve done just that.\nSadly, I have also recovered. I’m sure you were happy to see me die, but I’m not kind enough to give you the satisfaction. Freir has been a perfect gentleman since my coming home—he’s far better than you ever were.\nAlas, this letter is not simply for pleasantries. I hope you never thought you were special enough to me to merit a personal letter. I’d have completely forgotten you already except that you have information I want. I don’t care enough to not write you out of spite, so here we are.\nI lead you on a number of wild goose chases to find your precious gold orb. One of the people you talked to was a man named Selos Reykspor. I believe it was the second day you were here, but, seeing as I didn’t sleep the four days you were in Falsk, I don’t remember exactly. I was caught up in a number of other things at the time, and forgot to ask what he said to you.\nI’m eager to see Selos rot in prison for some personal injustices he’s committed against me. A hanging would be too quick a death. Starvation is more fitting. I’ll have him beg for his life, then his death, and I’ll give him neither.\nEnclosed you’ll find fifty gold pieces. That’s a promise. If you give me information about Selos, I’ll give you another hundred. If you give me something I can use to destroy him, I may slip and add an extra zero.\nEnjoy brutishly killing things,'

      text: 'Dearest Davian, \n I was thinking about you the other day. The streets were grimy from rain and all the worms were writhing and dying in the muck. I thought about how ridiculous they looked on the surface and how much they should have stayed underground. Those worms looked more at home on Falsk streets than you did. They at least had the good sense to die a few hours after they emerged. \n Thank you for kindly sending my money back. Since you were so unhelpful, I decided to do some good with it. I made a contribution to the concert hall on your behalf. I’m sure Skeigi will enjoy playing on a perfectly-tuned piano when he returns. I’ll make sure to tell him that you were the one who sent the money. The least I can do to repay you for our time together is to make sure he is well taken care of. \n I finally talked sense into some councilmen today and they signed off to lower the tariff on goods from underground. Don’t worry, the guards will still find and hang you if you take advantage of this treaty. I just thought I would let you know that your competition now has more of an advantage. I am really too kind to you. Any other person wouldn’t bother to warn you. \n Freir’s looking over my shoulder as I write. We are unbelievably happy. I am surprised I was able to pretend otherwise when you were here. That being said, you were not hard to fool. I hope the tunnels you travel through are more populated than your brain. \n I would be remiss if I did not ask again for information about Selos. If you don’t want money, there are other things I can pay you with. I have access to lots of information about trade underground. Do you want names? Travel routes? Name your price, I want Selos destroyed far more than I want to spite you. Selos is somewhat respectable in that he’s competent and, dare I say, menacing. You were as forgettable as the report on my desk this morning. I’ve never been so depressed about the human race than when I met you. \n Enjoy your tunnels and purple worms. I eagerly await your poisoned note, at least it would show some initiative. \n With love,'

I finally had time to finish some reports, and to use my own desk. Though I love Freir with all my heart, his desk is too small, and he doesn’t appreciate it when I pin things to his walls. He sometimes has trouble admitting that my job is more complicated and involved than his, and therefore requires any desk space at all. In his rare moments of idiocy, I think of you, who can make anyone look like a genius in comparison. \n I am so grateful for your gift, that I couldn’t help but return the favor. I offered a small reward to anyone who can bring back your head (separated from your body). I need something to feed Torin’s dogs. Don’t worry, it’s too small to attract any respectable hunters, but it will hopefully annoy you as much as you annoy me. If not, I can always raise the bounty. \n Also, the abyss is uncompelling, and I’ll therefore avoid rotting in it. After all, I actually do things with my life instead of hiding in underground tunnels. At the very least, I’m not afraid of the sun. Come to think of it, you are much closer to your ‘Abyss’ than I am. \n Affectionately yours,'

I feel honored to be one of the select few that you deign to think about, and I always strive to be worth your attention. To be compared to someone as respectable as Zephyra? That is just too much. Freir had to revive me from a fainting spell after I read those words. What would I do without your letters to keep me going? As you might expect, I would rather stab myself in the heart than lose your affections. You should see the walls of my room. They are plastered with your letters so I can better read them nightly. \n Feel free to kill all the messengers you want. I have more, and, as your body count goes up, I won’t need a bounty to convince people to hunt you down. Wait, I forgot, I obviously want you alive. I’ll be sure to cry when I leave your head out to rot. Thank you for the reminder. \n Tell Zephyra hi for me. I miss making a fool out of her. She was so delightful to make cry, though, from what I’ve heard, I can hardly beat your record. What does she see in you? Perhaps she loves the rotting stench you carry around with you everywhere, or maybe your pathetic attempt at intelligence. How could she not love your primitive excuse for a life? Don’t think that you are fooling her. She must feel sorry for you, or thinks she can change you. Enjoy the compassion — even if it comes from someone only marginally smarter than you. \n I have no gifts for you this time. This letter is all you get. I have a life to worry about, and the mud on my shoe is more important to me than our correspondence. Feel free to be rid of me forever, but if you decide to spite me by sharing some things that you know, you can trust that it will be the last thing you ever say. I hope you haven’t mistaken my toying with you as an actual show of my power. \n Sadly, I am out of time. Freir is taking me to a show tonight because he has money to spend on me. Remember all the things I paid for during your stay? I’m sure Zephyra enjoys taking care of you. You better hope she does, because nobody else will. You’re pathetic, and I’m sure Raven’s Port celebrates every time you return to your beloved tunnels. \n Sincerely,'

You may not be reading, which would make sense given you have no reason to read nor believe the words in this letter. Still, I do not have another place to turn. Perhaps you are right – I burned my bridges. Truth be told, a lot of my current situation came as a surprise, with little time to prepare. \n I promised you gold for information on Selos, but now I will offer you more for less. Keep sending letters. They can be empty for all I care, but at least send envelopes. Freir is still scared of you, and he is a little kinder when he sees one of your letters on the table. I know how pathetic this is, but I am low on options. I will pay you with gold, contracts, or names. If those are not appealing, I am sure I can be useful. Despite how it seems in this letter, I still have a wide range of influence, and am a good asset to have. \n You have no reason to believe any of this, but you are well outside Vothkar borders. There is nothing I can do with empty letters addressed to me from you. Especially because you never intend on coming back. This is an opportunity for you to make an easy profit, and, on the smallest chance that I am not lying to you, it would be a huge favor to me. \n Enjoy your travels,'

It's best to avoid playing Sura in any sort of trivia game, but you don't have to worry about that. \n I wanted to thank you and apologize.

I'm sure you heard the story behind it all, and I'd rather not write it out. \n I also wanted to thank you for being kind to me. You had no reason to be, and you could have easily taken advantage of the situation. You are definitely kinder than I will ever be. \n My guess is that Aenna forced you to leave somehow. She is the cause of everything horrible, and the things people are saying about you and Davian are pretty horrible. I struggle to believe you came to Falsk on an assassination contract. Framing you seems like something Aenna would do. Probably another diabolical plot designed to ruin every life except her own. Sura didn't say I was wrong when I brought it up, which is essentially an affirmation. It's probably good you got away. Aenna is as evil as they come. She belongs with all the monsters you taken down. I hope someone else outsmarts her someday and she can get what she deserves. Not sure if there's a punishment big enough for her at this point. Hanging would be too kind. \n I hope you return to Ravens Port, and that this letter gets there as well.

      text: 'Dear Zephyra, \n I’m glad my letter made it. Even if it was addressed to the right place, I wasn’t sure it would actually make the entire journey. Hopefully, it was still sealed. As soon as I sent it out, I realized I probably should have been a bit more careful, and then I decided my reputation couldn’t get any worse, so it was fine. My secret isn’t out completely (I guess Aenna is still “saving” me from the publicity), but Sura says there are rumors, so that’s pretty much the end of me. \n Ottilie is technically my first name, and my mother’s middle name, but I started going by Niera after she died. It was when I was really young, so don’t feel bad. I remember she had dark hair, but that’s about it, and that might just be because I’ve seen pictures. \n Sura told me a long time ago that I still had to sign Ottilie on official documents, but I’m pretty sure that’s bull. It was the signature I practiced, though, and signatures are kind of a big deal here. \n It was the ancient seer Isilmara who said that a name holds a shadow of a soul. There’s a number of different translations on that one, but they’re all wrong. I don’t know how things are in Ravens Port, but I’ve about decided that all of Vothkar has been cursed with terrible historians. I know it’s irrational (which shouldn’t be surprising coming from me), but I still haven’t forgiven my mother for dying and leaving me with Aenna. I know she didn’t have a choice, but…as I said: irrational. Every time I sign my name, I try to think better of her. So far, it hasn’t worked. \n You made the papers for about a week, but I think the guard ran out of things to accuse you of. It got funny by the end. Davian ended up the leader of an underground crime ring, and you were a jewel thief, among other things. I know how these things go. Despite what people like to say, newspapers are for entertainment purposes only, and it wasn’t hard to see that the media was lying about you. However, if you were somehow a part of Aenna getting her throat slit, you should have finished the job. It would have saved Falsk a lot of trouble. Plus, it feels right that she would be murdered. It’s appropriately dramatic. \n Sorry. I should probably try to be nicer, but it’s hard when your sister is a literal demon. You met her, so you understand. \n You’re glad you left when you did. I may have been annoying before, but at least you could leave the room. Now I’m a walking monster ready to strike. It’s taken me four sittings to get this far in the letter because I can’t sit still, or I freak out. It’s the tiniest stuff: I once yelled at Sura for twenty minutes because she put flowers in my room without asking. I don’t know why she puts up with me. I wish I was better, and I really try to be nice, but it’s hard. The whole drug thing started because it was the only way to calm down and stay calm for long periods of time. I can admit now that it got out of hand, but my motives were pure. Now I don’t have anything. \n I still live at Sura’s house. She doesn’t trust me, but somehow hasn’t lost all patience with my…episodes. We don’t talk much anymore. She’s at work most of the day, so it took me a while to notice the silence. I don’t know how she lives in her house. It’s cramped and all the furniture is too nice. I feel bad sitting on the couch, and I don’t dare eat in my room in case I spill and ruin something expensive. You never saw my house, but I think you would’ve liked it. You never have to worry about breaking anything, because everything is already half-broken. Sura calls my living room the furniture graveyard, but I love it. There aren’t as many stairs, either, which is an added benefit, and everything is more spacious. I may hate being alone, but I enjoy having my own space without Sura constantly looking over my shoulder. \n I’ve been going to work again, which is nice. I hate work, but it’s better than doing nothing…at least, that’s what I thought it would be. A lot of my job is boring tables, charts and general pencil pushing, but every month I get to visit the guard and log estimates for how much things are worth. Sura could no-doubt tell you the importance of this activity, but I don’t care. It took a couple years, but I finally got the guard to stop treating me like someone important. We hang out for a week, I write some random numbers on the form I’m supposed to fill out, and then I have to wait another month before I can do it again. Lots of them shamelessly flirt with me, which I don’t mind, and I’ve convinced the captains to switch off giving me sword-fighting lessons. Before you think I’m any good, I’ll inform you that I can hold a rapier correctly, and that’s about it. \n This week has been one terrible day after the other. Idin is there. I must have not recognized him before, but now he seems to be everywhere, and I think he’s the one teaching me rapier tomorrow. Maybe I can move. Littenby isn’t far away. I could probably start a new life there. \n I realize now you may not know who Idin is, and I feel bad for mentioning him. He’s a guard…captain, I assume. I haven’t had a good look at his uniform because I walk away as quickly as I can whenever I see him. He’s the one that found me and kept me alive on that day you and I met. I’m grateful, but that doesn’t mean I want to see him. He knows too much about me, he could arrest me at any time, and it’s weird. I’m not sure if seeing him at work is any worse than seeing him at home, though. He’s come by a couple times, and we sometimes talk. I don’t know what he wants from me, but I’ve already thanked him a thousand times, so I think I’ve fulfilled my social duty. \n That’s all, so YOU have to tell me everything now. Is there an actual Rosemund? Is Davian finally gone for good? Did you fight any magical creatures along the way? Do dragons actually exist? \n sjáumst,'

I don’t know how magic works, but I assume it’s well within the realm of possibility to be able to see the future, or, a future? I’m glad I got to be there, even if they were only visions. It gives me hope. So, thanks for that. \n But the memories. That must be torture. I can’t imagine how miserable that must be, but I think you made the right choice. I hope so. I wish you could be happier about it. Life can sometimes be so… cruel. Maybe, with time, it will get better? That’s what Sura tells me, and she is usually right. \n I keep having to remember that you don’t know me that well. I always assume you know all the craziness that is my life, but then I realize I should probably explain it to you. This is my long way of saying that I might understand a tiny bit of what you’re feeling. This might not be what you want to read right now, so I don’t blame you at all if you don’t. Some people like to be alone in their pain, so I don’t want to intrude. \n I think in my last letter I told you what a horrible person I am. It’s not just that, though. Maybe it’s all caused by the same thing, but I also have the horrible talent of falling in love too soon. I have found my Skeigi a countless number of times, except they all end up being self-absorbed jerks. I loved them, though. I would have married each and every one of them. Maybe I’ve read too many books, but I feel those stereotypical things every time — my heart gets ripped out, the world loses its color, all of that sappy stuff. I make fun of it now, but I think that’s only because I’ve been single for over a month now. I don’t think that’s happened since I was 15. \n It usually goes as follows: \n 1. Sura (usually just Aenna’s messenger) tells me I have to distract someone, or convince someone of something, or really have any benign interaction with a man. \n 2. This man always ends up being ridiculously handsome. I don’t know why Sura never asks me to talk to ugly people. I always end up having to fake-flirt with drop dead gorgeous men. Although, I was looking through pictures while writing this letter, and maybe I was just drunk. \n 3. I flirt, he flirts, and I start to believe he actually likes me. This takes around five minutes. All they have to do is smile and say my name and I’m gone. This is not something I’m proud of, but I’ve had to come to terms with it. \n 4. I may be a 3rd child, but I still have money and an important last name. It’s not hard to convince people to date me. Half the time, they just want to use me for something or steal my money. I don’t think anyone has sincerely liked me. \n 5. By the next morning, I’m seriously in love. If Sura hadn’t scared them all away, then I would have gotten married at 16 ½, or any month after that. I would have died for several men after only a couple days of knowing them. I almost have. \n 6. I’m so far gone, there’s nothing Sura can do. She’s probably wanted to strangle me several hundred times, and she’s probably had to stop Aenna from doing so at least several times. It takes anywhere from two weeks to a month for the new love of my life to dump me. I am not a nice person to be around, and it doesn’t take long for people to see that my craziness is not an act. I don’t blame them for running. \n 7. I decide that life has lost all meaning. When it happens, I’m only a little better than how I was when you met me. Usually, though, I lock myself in my house and nobody else has to deal with it. Now that I write it, I see that it was stupid of me to imply that I know how you feel. You have something real. I never did, but at the time, I felt that each of those men were my other half. I never had magic visions, but I certainly made my own. \n I wish I could help you instead of writing a useless letter that probably only made you feel worse. I hope things get better for you. Maybe Rosamund and Berg know how to help you heal. I wish I could give you news about Skeigi, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him except on his posters. Those kinds of concerts have never been my thing. Maybe it’s the sitting down for two hours straight. I’m not patient enough to count the swords in the barracks, so there’s no way I could make it through a Skeigi concert. I’ll keep my ears open, but you should probably find another source of information about him. \n I’ve almost thrown this letter away so many times, so I’ll write a funny story so I can convince myself you won’t hate it. \n Remember Idin from last letter? He is not terrible. He definitely could have been a lot worse while I was at the barracks, but he still annoyingly casual with me. This story is not about him, but about his friend. \n Aalder joined the guard around two months ago. He’s probably the best person in the whole organization. He’s hilarious, but in an adorable, overly dramatic sort of way. Lest you are already getting worried, I am not dating him, but mostly because he hasn’t asked me… and he never will because I’m way out of his league. I kind of wish I wasn’t. \n The last day I was there before I had to go back to the office, the whole place was in complete chaos. I stole my way through the front office because I could hear things going on. In the middle of the main sparring ring was a huge peacock. I don’t know how he got a hold of it, but Aalder somehow smuggled it in, and let it loose without anyone catching him. \n Everyone knew he had done it. Nobody else would have. She must have planned it for when I was there so that I could make sure he didn’t get fired. I included a feather with this letter as proof. \n We could hardly get anything done the entire day. Even after they wrangled the bird, they didn’t have anywhere to put it. They couldn’t let it loose on the streets – it had to belong to somebody. I don’t know what they ended up doing with it. I was a little distracted because Aalder found me laughing and confessed to the whole thing. I think he told me how he did it, but I had to focus on not kissing him. He is so amazing, and I wish you could meet him, but you can’t write Sura about any of this. She will keep me from leaving this house forever, and I’ll die a slow and horrible death as I suffocate in her tiny rooms. \n Seriously, Aalder is different than all the other ones. We genuinely like each other, which is helped by the fact that he is practically perfect. We will never happen, though. I’m rich, and he’s not, and he’ll never have the courage to ask me out. I’ll just have to deal with it. \n That’s my funny story, and I hope it makes things better for a little while. Hang in there. \n Wish I could help more,'
